  <h2>About me </h2>
  <p>
      Hi .I am Rishabh. I am a resident of Bhopal , Madhya Pradesh. Presently, I am Student of MTech in CSE at IIIT Hyderabad. I completed my Bachelors from The LNM Institute of Information Technology Jaipur.
      I am aspiring to be a software developer. Since childhood I was always interested in computers and programming. It always fascinated me 
      how programmers were able to instruct the computer to perform sophisticated tasks so elegantly. I also liked playing computer games and 
      was curious to know how they work. This fascination and interest was the primary reason I decided to pursue computer science .
